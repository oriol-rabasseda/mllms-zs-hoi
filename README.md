## ðŸ“Œ Abstract
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel as zero-shot reasoners across diverse domains. However, their application to real-world classification tasks, particularly in direct comparison with specialized models, remains underexplored. This work explores how MLLMs can be leveraged for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition and detection using token probability outputs. We first benchmark lightweight MLLMs, identifying Qwen2-VL and MiniCPM-V as the most effective families. We then propose a comprehensive taxonomy of zero-shot strategies, integrating textual prompting methods and visual prompting techniques. For HOI detection, we develop Objects as In-Context Learning (ICL) and Black Other Objects methods for object specification. Evaluations on HICO dataset reveal that Objects as ICL boosts performance for multi-image-capable MLLMs, while ensembling text prompts enhances robustness. On HICO-DET, Objects as ICL, Black Other Objects, and Blur the Background emerge as superior visual prompting methods for localization. Our approach achieves 53.50 mAP on HICO and 23.69 mAP on HICO-DET, outperforming prior zero-shot methods and approaching the performance of certain supervised models.
